# Theme Your Samsung Bootloader
Bored with Samsung's default bootloader theme? You've come to the right place.

# Tutorial

Download the BL (bootloader) file for your device (you can use the modified bootloader i made, maybe it will work on all samsung phones)
you can download modifed and unmodify up_param.bin here (link come soon) explain: the file up_param.bin contains lots of texture of the bootloader including the big red warning that your phone is running unofficial software or the boot loader unlocked menu.

# Flash
To flash this custom up_param.bin you need to compress the file into a .tar file then use odin to flash it to the bootloader partition.
